### In brief

> Many psychological studies, both applied and experimental, make repeated measurements
> of some kind. Dealing with these with confidence is the focus of this option. In this
> first session on repeated measures data we introduce the idea of partitioning
> variance, and attributing it to different groupings in our data. We discuss how this
> is related to statistical power, and fit the same pre-post RCT data with Ancova and a
> ‘mixed’ model. At the end of this session you should be able to identify tradeoffs in
> sampling strategies for repeat measures studies and understand the drivers for dealing
> with repeat measures data with appropriate techniques.

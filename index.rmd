------------------


> This short course aims to extend your existing skills, and give you confidence when
> working with and analysing repeated measures data. We use examples from typical
> experimental and applied studies in psychology. We cover repeat measures Anova
> designs, more general mixed-effects and random-slope models, and touch on Bayesian
> parameter estimation for mixed models. We also  learn how to test specific hypotheses 
> from mixed models.

# Approach

In common with all modules at Plymouth, we try to avoid the 'bag of tricks' approach to
teaching research methods and try to integrate new skills into a broader approach to
collecting and using data. Our workflow is inspired by Wickham's model for data science:
[Wickham, 2017](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html):

In this option we do teach specific techniques, but the aim is always to help you
integrate this new knowledge into your own research practice.



# Access to R

Throughout the module we use R for data processing and analysis.

If you are taking this course at Plymouth University, the easiest way to run the code
examples here is to the school's RStudio Server.

### Installing at home

If you want to install R on your own machine, instructions are available here:

Be sure to install the recommended packages or the examples given here won't work.

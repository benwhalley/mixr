["assessment.html", "Assessment", " Assessment The REFRAMED trial was a large RCT evaluating a variant of dialectical behaviour therapy for patients with treatment-resistant depression (Lynch et al. 2018). The design of the study is described in detail in Lynch et al. (2015). The original, uncentered data, used for this analysis are available here: data/reframed.csv. Make a plot which shows changes in PHQ9 scores over time, split by group. It can either look like the plot below, or display the differences between groups over time in another appropriate way: Changes in PHQ9 Scores during the REFRAMED trial Fit a random intercepts model using lmer, including month as a fixed factor (a categorical variable). Also include treatment group, and the interaction of month and group. Report the model you run and interpret the model output, and report relevant statistics covered during the course. Be sure to report the % variance attributable to between-patient differences. Use the guidelines in Meteyard and Davies (2020) when deciding what to report. Examine the code and output below. The variable phq9.c is a copy of the original dataset in which all the numeric variables have been mean-centered. Give a descriptive label/subtitle to each of the sections A to D below. Comment on each line in the code, explaining what it does, and what the output (if any) means. Use the R help files as a reference to functions if needed. With reference to the plot above, why do you think that observations after month 12 are excluded from this analysis? Given the model formula used and the design of the study, what other observations might it be reasonable to exclude? Which model should we prefer, phq9.m2 or phq9.m3? Is model phq9.m3 ‘maximal’ Barr et al. (2013)?
